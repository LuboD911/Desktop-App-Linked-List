Problem:

Develop a desktop application on Windows or Linux that implements a singly linked list of integers (user-entered) and returns the value of the Mth (user-entered) element from the end of the list such that when M = 0 the last element of the list is returned. Make sure you devise a time- and space-efficient algorithm that only uses the head of the list and M as input and take care to handle relevant error conditions.

Example:

1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 and M = 0 must return the value of 5 (the value of the last element).
1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 and M = 1 must return the value of 2 (the value of the element before the last)
