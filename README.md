Run the GUI.py file. Then you will see two empty fields.
With the first one, you can add numbers to the list (one number or multiple space-separated numbers).
The second one is for the M number. Simply write the number and click the button next to the field.
Under them, you can see the result and current elements in the list. 
You can also empty the list with the ‘Clear list’ button.
